# Optional Program 2 - Binary Search Tree vs. AVL Tree

This program simulates basic behavior common to both Binary Search Trees and AVL Trees (insertion, searching and deletion) and compares the runtimes for each operation.

Some test wrappers were created for each tree structure. These wrappers simply extend their base classes and adds a timer to measure runtimes for each operation.

These runtime comparisons are printed on the terminal.
